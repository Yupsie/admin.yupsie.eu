## Typical README.md introduction
> Blockquotes

As others have noted, README should be simple and short, but a good README can save time especially if it's for something like command-line parameter parsing library.

*Italic*
**Bold**
Both bold and italic can use either a * or an _ around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.

**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**

- name of the projects and all sub-modules and libraries (sometimes they are named different and very confusing to new users)
- descriptions of all the project, and all sub-modules and libraries
- 5-line code snippet on how its used (if it's a library)
- copyright and licensing information (or "Read LICENSE")
- instruction to grab the documentation
- instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs
- instruction to grab the latest code and detailed instructions to build it (or quick overview and "Read INSTALL")
- list of authors or "Read AUTHORS"
- instructions to submit bugs, feature requests, submit patches, join mailing list, get announcements, or join the user or dev community in other forms
- other contact info (email address, website, company name, address, etc)
- a brief history if it's a replacement or a fork of something else
- legal notices (crypto stuff)
- Apache HTTP Server has a simple yet good README. Another good one I found available online is GNU Make's README.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

`code` and turn it into `**code**format`.
